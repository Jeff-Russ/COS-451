Map coloring is a good example: We care less about the *path* to solution than we do about the solution itself. CSPs are a set of variables that are assigned values within a domain that must satisfy a set of **constraints**. A lot of problems can be formulated as a CSPs, which makes them popular. There are a lot of general-purpose CSP solvers available and since they are often used to find or approximate solution to known hard problems.  \n",
