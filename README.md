The in-class exercises make use of Jupyter. Recommend installing [Anaconda 3](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#windows), which includes Jupyter and JupyterLab. **It is not recommended to install Anaconda for "All Users", otherwise you will have to run the Anaconda Prompt as an Administrator!**

If you do not have `git` on your workstation, then you can install it using Anaconda:

* Open the *Anaconda Prompt*
* Run the command: *conda install git* (You may need to disable McAffee's Quick Scan on Army machines). 
* You can now run the *git clone* command above in the *Anaconda Prompt*.
