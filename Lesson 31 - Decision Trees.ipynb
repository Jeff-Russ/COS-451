    "## Decision Trees\n",
    "A decision tree is a flowchart that uses a tree of decisions and their possible consequences for classification. At each non-leaf node of the tree an attribute of the input is tested, based on which corresponding branch leading to a child-node is selected. At the leaf node the input is classified based on the class label of this leaf node. The paths from root to leaves represent classification rules based on which leaf nodes are assigned class labels.\n",

    "### Decision Tree Learning\n",
    "Decision tree learning is the construction of a decision tree from class-labeled training data. The data is expected to be a tuple in which each record of the tuple is an attribute used for classification. The decision tree is built top-down, by choosing a variable at each step that best splits the set of items. There are different metrics for measuring the \"best split\". These generally measure the homogeneity of the target variable within the subsets.\n",

    "#### Gini Impurity\n",
    "Gini impurity of a set is the probability of a randomly chosen element to be incorrectly labeled if it was randomly labeled according to the distribution of labels in the set.\n",

    "$$I_G(p) = \\sum{p_i(1 - p_i)} = 1 - \\sum{p_i^2}$$\n",

    "#### Information Gain\n",

    "Information Gain is difference between entropy of the parent and weighted sum of entropy of children. The feature used for splitting is the one which provides the most information gain.\n",
