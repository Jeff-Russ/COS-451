    "Many problems can be solved using search graphs where nodes are states of the problem and edges are actions that move from one state to another with some cost. The authors of our book, ***Artifical Intelligence: A Modern Approach (AIMA)***, also maintain a [github page](https://github.com/aimacode) with interactive demos and example code for solving problems using search algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we will use the AIMA search libraries to construct a search problem. Since the AIMA libraries are not distributed as a package, we have to manually add the local folder to Python's import search path. You can do that by executing the following code:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "import os, sys\n",
