    "\n",
    "Rejection Sampling is based on an idea similar to what we did just now. First, it generates samples from the prior distribution specified by the network. Then, it rejects all those that do not match the evidence. Rejection sampling is advantageous only when we know the query beforehand. While prior sampling generally works for any query, it might fail in some scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have a generic Bayesian network and we have evidence `e`, and we want to know how many times a state `A` is true, given evidence `e` is true. Normally, prior sampling can answer this question, but let's assume that the probability of evidence `e` being true in our actual probability distribution is very small. In this situation, it might be possible that sampling never encounters a data-point where `e` is true. If our sampled data has no instance of `e` being true, `P(e) = 0`, and therefore `P(A | e) / P(e) = 0/0`, which is undefined. We cannot find the required value using this sample. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can definitely increase the number of sample points, but we can never guarantee that we will encounter the case where `e` is non-zero (assuming our actual probability distribution has at least one case where `e` is true).\n",
    "To guarantee this, we would have to consider every single data point, which means we lose the speed advantage that approximation provides us and we essentially have to calculate the exact inference model of the Bayesian network. Rejection sampling will be useful in this situation, as we already know the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "While sampling from the network, we will reject any sample which is inconsistent with the evidence variables of the given query (in this example, the only evidence variable is `e`).\n",
